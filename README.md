# 😀 Introduce

Although I majored in software engineering as an undergraduate, this did not make me have a more solid professional knowledge foundation than others when I graduated in 2020, and I did not even know what front-end development was about at that time. Later, I simply learned about front-end development through friends, and I found it very interesting to learn it slowly. 

In the past two or three years, I regret that I just gained some knowledge on the job and did not devote some of my spare time to learning technology.In the past two or three years, I've just been gaining knowledge on the job, not using my spare time to learn technology. We all know that it is very difficult to create something out of thin air in this world, which requires both raw material investment and money support. The beauty of code is that it can help us create things that change our lives and even the world. From now on, I will continue to explore full stack development, towards allowing myself to live the life I want to start!
